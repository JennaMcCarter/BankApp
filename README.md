# BankApp

I elected to create a web-based application complete with a consistent UI design and a fun backstory of “The Bank of the Moon” based on the popular Sailor Moon series.

## Tools Used:
*	HTML
*	CSS
*	JavaScript
*	C#
*	MVC & MVC Authentication

## My Work Methodology:
For my work process, I first made a list of all functionality and grouped them based on how they related to the overall project. For example, login and logout relate to the overall application while checking balance, withdrawing, depositing, and viewing history relate to a bank account.

From there, I then made a list of needed pages and created the views. After that, I then created the models that would be needed to display the information. I used cookies to store the transactions and used a controller to manage what views got what information.
Once everything was working the way I wanted it to, I styled the pages and added additional (but not needed) content.

Lastly, I did user testing and fixes (recruiting family members for my QA testers).

## Project Documentation:
I have included comments inside the code for you to follow along with my thought process.

## Next Time for Version “2”:
If I had more time to make this even better, there would be a lot of things I would have liked to implement or change with that project. For example, I would add more validation for items such as not being able to put in certain values when withdrawing or depositing. And, I would check validation on the front end and the back end. I would also make it possible so that different accounts would have different transactions and not show the same thing for all users.
